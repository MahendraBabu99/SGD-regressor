K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS REGRESSOR (KNN REGRESSOR)

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm used for regression.
It makes predictions based on the target values of the closest data points in the feature space.

WHAT IS KNN REGRESSOR

KNN Regressor does not learn an explicit model during training.
Instead, it stores the entire training dataset and performs computation only at prediction time.

Prediction rule:

Given a new input 
𝑥
x:

Find the K closest points in the training data

Aggregate their target values (usually mean)

Return the aggregated value as the prediction
y^​(x)=K1​i∈KNN(x)∑​yi​
	​

WHY USE KNN REGRESSOR

Simple and intuitive

Captures non-linear patterns

No training phase

No assumptions about data distribution

WHEN TO USE KNN REGRESSOR

Use KNN Regressor when:

Dataset is small to medium

Relationships are non-linear

Local patterns matter

You want a baseline model

Avoid KNN Regressor when:

Dataset is very large

Dimensionality is high

Real-time prediction is required

Data is noisy

KEY HYPERPARAMETERS

n_neighbors (K):

Number of nearest neighbors

Small K → overfitting

Large K → underfitting

weights:

uniform → equal weight

distance → closer points matter more

metric:

euclidean (default)

manhattan

minkowski

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT

Feature scaling is mandatory.

Distance-based models are sensitive to feature magnitude.
Always apply:

StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler
