GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR (GBR)

Gradient Boosting Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds a strong regression model by combining multiple weak learners (decision trees) trained sequentially. Each new tree corrects the errors made by the previous trees.

WHAT IS GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR

Gradient Boosting Regressor minimizes a loss function by adding trees in a stage-wise manner. At each stage, a new tree is trained on the residuals (negative gradients) of the loss function.

Core idea:

Start with a simple model

Iteratively add trees to reduce prediction error

Optimize using gradient descent in function space

WHY USE GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR

Handles complex non-linear relationships

Captures feature interactions automatically

High predictive accuracy on tabular data

Robust to outliers (with appropriate loss)

Does not require feature scaling

WHEN TO USE GRADIENT BOOSTING REGRESSOR

Use GBR when:

Data has non-linear patterns

High accuracy is required

Dataset fits into memory

Feature interactions are important

Prediction uncertainty is needed

Avoid GBR when:

Dataset is extremely large

Online or incremental learning is required

Training time must be minimal

MODEL OBJECTIVE

General objective:

min_f Σ L(y, f(x))

Where:

L is the loss function

f(x) is an additive model of decision trees

IMPORTANT HYPERPARAMETERS

n_estimators:

Number of boosting stages (trees)

learning_rate:

Shrinks contribution of each tree

Smaller values improve generalization

max_depth:

Depth of individual trees

Controls model complexity

min_samples_leaf:

Minimum samples per leaf

Reduces overfitting

subsample:

Fraction of samples used per tree

Introduces randomness (stochastic boosting)
